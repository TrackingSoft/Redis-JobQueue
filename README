DEPENDENCIES

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version

packages that are distributed separately from Perl. We recommend that
you have the following packages installed before you install
Redis::JobQueue :

   Data::UUID
   Digest::SHA1

The Redis::JobQueue package has the following optional dependencies:
